<p class="small-text"> Naomi Parker Fraley, above right, and the poster she inspired.</p>
<h6><b>Here is a short biography of Naomi Parker Fraley's and her life surrounding the poster controversary:</b></h6>
<ul>
  <li>Naomi Fern Parker was born in Tulsa, Okla., on Aug. 26, 1921. </li>
  <li>Parker was the third of eight children to Joseph Parker and Esther Leis.</li>
  <li>Her father's job caused the family to move a lot, and they were living in Alameda at the time of the Pearl Harbor attack.</li>
  <li>Fraley and her younger sister went to work at the Naval Air station, where they were assigned to the machine shop for aircraft assembling duties.</li>
  <li>In 1942, her photograph was taken at a shaper and it appeared in the Pittsburgh Press. </li>
  <li>The following year Howard Miller's "We Can Do It!" poster appeared in factories as part of a series intended to boost morale.</li>
  <li> Miller could have seen the picture of Fraley and it is presumed that the newspaper photo was the source of his image.</li>
  <li>In 2011, Fraley was at a reunion held at a historical park when she spotted the photo.  “I did think it looked like me,” she told People Magazine. She was surprised to see the caption stated the woman was Geraldine Hoff Doyle. (Doyle had felt she recognized herself in both the photograph and the poster. The misidentification spread.)</li>
  <li>Fraley wrote to the park to inform them of their mistake and they thanked her.</li>
  <li> Seton Hall University professor James J. Kimble had become interested in the poster which was now an icon of the feminist movement.</li>He tracked down the original picture and saw it  was the original caption that showed the woman pictured was "Naomi Parker". </li>
  <li>He then found Parker and was certain she was the woman in the photo. However, Miller, the poster creator, left behind no writings to indicate who the woman might be.</li>
<li>In her personal life, Fraley was married three times. She acquired the name Fraley from her third husband, who died in 1988.</li>
<li>She died on January 20, 2018, in Longview, Washington at the age of 96.</li>
<li>In 2016, the World-Herald interviewed Fraley and asked her how it felt to be identified as the real life Rosie the Riviter. Her response? "“Victory! Victory! Victory!”</li>
